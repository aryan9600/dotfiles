This is a repository of my dotfiles that I used to configure my development enviornment on macOS 10.13.6

Currently, it contains my:

* [neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration.
* [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) settings.
* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) configuration.
